# Discord-Bot
This is a bot I made for my discord server. 
It has a set of commands that were useful for me including,
- bot logs, which displays logs without having to open audit logs.
- Jail system which mutes and deafen whoever has role "jail" and does not allow them to join any voice channel.
- Mini games such as rock/paper/scissors, 8ball, coinflip.
- Find and reply with a gif using tenor gif API.
